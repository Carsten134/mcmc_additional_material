This is all the code from Moritz Warneke, who was responsible for implementing and testing the Slicing algorithm.

The single and multidimensional are also available in the [R-package](https://github.com/Carsten134/rmcmc).

### What was written
- A single dimensional implementation, which samples from a single interval
- A multidimensional implementation, which uses the stepping out and shrinkage procedure
- Testing for extreme values and multimodal distributions
- Benchmarking time
- Mutlivariate normal simulation for Report
